# Pipe-Firestarter-Storage-Node-Run-Full-Guide

## Introduction
Pipe Network is transforming media streaming with a decentralized Content Delivery Network (CDN) on Solana’s high-performance blockchain. This secure, scalable, and hyper-localized solution enables permissionless contributors to deploy Points of Presence (PoPs) in targeted regions, ensuring lightning-fast access to high-quality media and real-time applications.

By removing the need for costly centralized infrastructure, Pipe Network enables rapid scaling and unmatched content streaming. The network offers the essential infrastructure for developers, operators, and content providers to thrive in the digital age.

Pipe Network aims to create a hyper-localized, scalable CDN that leverages Solana’s high-performance blockchain to deliver content faster, more securely, and more efficiently than traditional centralized CDNs, such as Cloudflare. The project incentivizes users to host internet infrastructure by running nodes, contributing to a decentralized ecosystem. This approach is part of a broader trend in decentralized infrastructure networks (DePIN), which seek to distribute and democratize access to digital services.

## Key Features
- Hyperlocal PoP Nodes: Ultra-low latency (<10ms) via nodes close to users.
- Permissionless Participation: Anyone can run nodes, boosting scalability.
- Solana-Based: Fast, secure, and scalable using Solana’s blockchain.
- Distributed Caching: Local content caching for efficient delivery.

## Airdrop Details
Status: NOt Confirmed any Airdrop

Payments are made in $PIPE tokens (Devnet) (1 PIPE ≈ 1 GB). When tokens are burned for storage, they are re-minted and rewarded to node operators—so the community runs the infrastructure, not corporations.

In short: Firestarter gives developers and users a full-stack decentralized alternative for storage, CDN, and edge compute at a fraction of the cost.



### Funding Source
